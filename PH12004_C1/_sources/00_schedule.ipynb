The notes for this part of the course have all been written in Notebooks. \n",

But you will also learn how to fix your mistakes and how to find answers to tricky problems. Don't feel like you need to work on these worksheets by yourself. Please talk to your coursemates and help eachother. One of the most effective ways to learn something is to explain it to someone else!"
