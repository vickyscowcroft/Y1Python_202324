    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are a way of running Python code (and other languages). Notebooks enable you to keep notes, images, equations etc. together with your code. They do this by using different types of 'cells'. The main types of cells are code cells and markdown cells. We'll cover these in more detail as we get to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because you can keep notes etc. alongside your code, you can use Jupyter notebooks like a lab book. Just like when you're in the lab, it's important to write down what you're doing in your code and analysis; when you come back to a notebook at a later date with no recollection of what you did before, you'll thank your past self for making such clear notes.\n"
